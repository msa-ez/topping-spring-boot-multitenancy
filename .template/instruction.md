#### Overview: In the partitioned multi-tenancy approach, data from multiple tenants resides in the same database tables but is partitioned by using a specific column, often called the tenant_id. Each row in the table is tied to a specific tenant based on this column's value.

#### Data Separation: All tenants share the same table schema, but data is logically separated and isolated by the tenant identifier. This ensures that one tenant cannot access another tenant's data.

#### Benefits:
- Resource Utilization: Since data from all tenants is stored in shared tables, you can efficiently utilize database resources without the need for separate schemas or databases.
- Maintenance: Database maintenance tasks such as backups, indexing, and updates can be performed uniformly without the need to manage each tenant separately.
- Scalability: As your number of tenants grows, there's no need to continually add new schemas or databases, ensuring easier scalability.
- Consistency: The application code remains consistent for all tenants as there's a single database structure, simplifying application logic and maintenance.

#### Security: Just as with other multi-tenancy approaches, you must ensure strict security practices. With partitioned multi-tenancy, this often means diligently filtering queries by the tenant_id to ensure data isolation.

#### Considerations:
- Complex Queries: As data grows, certain queries, especially those involving JOIN operations, can become complex and may need optimization.
- Migration: If a tenant grows significantly and there's a need to move them to their own database or schema, migration can be a bit challenging compared to the schema-based approach.
- Overhead: The application must always be aware of the current tenant context and apply the correct tenant_id filtering for every database operation.
